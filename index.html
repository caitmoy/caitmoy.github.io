			<h1><b>My Experience</b></h1>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md" id="Experience1">
					<h2>Mazzeo Technology Research Group</h2>
					<p1>Over the course of six months, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant, designing food 
						safety containers and sample objects through the use of <b>3D CAD</b> modelling software. By self-studying
						 <b>MATLAB</b>, I generated 100+ simulations that calculated the average distance between various 
						 agricultural produce surfaces and containers.  I analyzed this output data to identify and
						  recommend the containers with the optimal metrics to the research lead.
					</p1>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md" id="Experience2">			
					<h2>Rutgers Product Co.</h2>
					<p1>In my coursework and side projects, I focus on the software development aspect of making a product. 
						So, as <b>Vice President of Product Marketing</b> for Rutgers Product Co, a student-led creative incubator, 
						I get to explore product development from a business perspective. For this role, I supervise a team 
						of five education directors in the development of an 8-week product marketing curriculum, covering topics
						 from Search Engine Optimization to building GTM strategies. This fall, I will conduct classes of 10-15
						  fellows and lead them in case study discussions as well as various marketing initiatives.  </p1>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md" id="Experience3">
					<h2>J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.</h2>
					<p1> Winter break 2019, I completed JP Morgan Chase’s software engineering virtual internship.
						 This program centered around <b>frontend web development</b> and data visualization with Perspective.
						  I used Python to repair a broken client data feed script in order to output stock information.
						   Through this program, I learned about the role of a software engineer in financial services and 
						   familiarized myself with JP Morgan Chase’s development tools.</p1>

					<h2>This Website</h2>
					<p1>To learn more about web development and design, I decided to build this site!
						  I used <b>Javascript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>, and I also used Bootstrap
						   to make certain elements responsive. Feel free to check out the code on my github—I had a lot of fun with this project!   </p1>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md" id="Project2">
					<h2>The Effect of Machine Translation on Interactions</h2>
					<p1>For my final project in the interdisciplinary honors seminar, Digital Technology and Disruptive Change, 
						I created a website to showcase my research paper, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/scarletmail.rutgers.edu/effectofmt/home"target="_blank"><i>The Effect of Machine Translation on Interactions</i></a>. 
						I enjoyed writing about this topic since it combined my two areas of interest: language and technology. For the paper,
						 I researched the impact of machine translation services on various areas, 
						 like the medical field, the work of professional translators, and everyday interpersonal relationships.</p1>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md" id="Project3">
					<h2>Knock-Knock Joke Generator</h2>
					<p1>At my first hackathon in the fall of my freshman year, I built a Knock-Knock Joke Generator, teaching myself the basics of <b>Javascript</b>,
						 <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b> and coding the site all within 24 hours. I loved sharing the project with my friends and family, and it inspired
						  me to volunteer at other hackathons and become more involved in my university’s CS community. </p1>

					<h2>Guitar</h2>
					<p1>I started learning guitar in 2009 and have kept up with it ever since. As a HUGE fan of the Beatles,
						 I love to play classic rock, but I also enjoy other genres, like fingerstyle guitar and folk.
						  I also play the bass guitar, ukulele, and sing. I’ve been performing since middle school and love
						   to play at school events when the opportunity comes up. </p1>

					<h2>Writing</h2>
					<p1>Writing is another hobby of mine that I try to incorporate into my life wherever I can. I enjoy writing
						 everything from informative school essays to creative flash fiction. In the future, I hope to tie this
						  interest in with my career, and write about language and technology topics, like my research paper in
						   the section above.
